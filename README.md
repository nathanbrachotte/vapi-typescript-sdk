# Vapi TypeScript SDK

This SDK provides a type-safe way to interact with the [Vapi API](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant). It offers a convenient and strongly-typed interface for making HTTP requests to Vapi's REST endpoints, making it easier for developers to integrate Vapi services into their TypeScript or JavaScript projects.
